                pieces of personal data that a business has collected about consumers.</p>
            <p>Request that a business delete any personal data about the consumer that a business has collected.</p>
            <p>Request that a business that sells a consumer's personal data, not sell the consumer's personal data.</p>
            <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these
                rights, please contact us.</p>

            <h2>GDPR Data Protection Rights</h2>

            <p>We would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every user is
                entitled to the following:</p>
            <p>The right to access – You have the right to request copies of your personal data. We may charge you a
                small fee for this service.</p>
            <p>The right to rectification – You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is
                inaccurate. You also have the right to request that we complete the information you believe is
                incomplete.</p>
            <p>The right to erasure – You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain
                conditions.</p>

                rights, please contact us.</p>

            <h2>Children's Information</h2>

            <p>Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage
                parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.</p>

            <p>rainfire does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of
                13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage
                you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from
                our records.</p>

            <h2>Payments</h2>

            <p>We may provide paid products and/or services within Service. In that case, we use third-party services
                for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).

                We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our
                third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy
                Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security
                Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and
                Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.</p>
